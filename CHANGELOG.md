==========

- Added: Support a `token` parameter so you can use the hosted application at `llm-tracker.tinybird.live` with your own Tinybird workspace:

```
curl https://tinybird.co | sh
tb login
tb --cloud deploy --template https://github.com/tinybirdco/llm-performance-tracker/tree/main/tinybird
TOKEN=$(tb auth info | grep "^token: " | awk '{print $2}')
open https://llm-tracker.tinybird.live\?token\=$TOKEN
```
